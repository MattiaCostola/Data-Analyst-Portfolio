<h1>Covid-19 Analysis </h1>
I use this popular data set: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data.git from https://covid.ourworldindata.org to perform an analysis about COVID-19.
<h2>I write the folllowing query:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cases Count by Months | Globally</li>
  <li>Deaths Count by Months | Globally</li>
  <li>Cases vs Deaths by Months | Globally </li>
  <li>Vaccinations Count by Month | Globally</li>
    <li>Which continent has had more cases?</li>
  <li>Which continent has had more deaths?</li>
  <li>Which continent has more fully vaccinated people?</li>
  <li>Total Cases by Months | Italy</li>
  <li>New Cases vs New Deaths by Months | Italy</li>
  <li>People Fully Vaccinated + New Vacinations by Months | Italy</li>
</ul>
