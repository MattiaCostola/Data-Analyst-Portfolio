<h1>Chess Game Analysis</h1>
Chess, Chess and Chess. The pandemic and the TV show "The Queen's Gambit" made chess popular again with thousand of players who started playing it again, myself included. After watching the popular TV series, I started playing a lot of chess games on a daily basis climbing the player rating every day.

Then, drove by the love of data, I analyzed a 20'000 chess game dataset from Lichess.org. Here is the result.

<h2>Question that I answered:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Are in the game of chess an advantage between using the white pieces vs the black ones? </li>
 <li>How people win most of the time? By mate or time? </li>
 <li>Which is the shorter game? How often the games end with less than 10 turns? </li>
 <li>Which are the most popular opening? </li>
 <li>Is there more probability to win if I start with a certain piece? </li>
 <li>And I looked for any correlation between the pieces' color and the player rating. </li>
</ul>
