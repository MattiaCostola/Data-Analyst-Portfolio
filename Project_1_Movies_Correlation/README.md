<h1> Project 1 - Movies Correlation </h1>
<p> I analyze a movie datset with Python to respond to the following questions:</p>

<ul>Correlations</ul>

<li> 1) Does higher budget mean higher revenue? </li> 

<li> 2) Do higher votes means higher revenue? </li> 

<li> 3) Does the runtime affect the revenue? </li> 

<p></p>

<ul> Other Questions</ul>

<li> 4) How many movies in the dataset, and from which year? </li> 

<li> 5) Which movie has the highest revenue? </li> 

<li> 6) Which movie has the highest revenue by year? </li> 

<li> 7) Which movie genre was most produced by year? </li>
