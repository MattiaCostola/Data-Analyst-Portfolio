This repository is for projects that I did after completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate which 
helped me learn about data analysis. The specialization was made up of 8 different courses:

- Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere
- Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions
- Prepare Data for Exploration
- Process Data from Dirty to Clean
- Analyze Data to Answer Questions
- Share Data Through the Art of Visualization
- Data Analysis with R Programming
- Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study

In addition to SQL and R, I also learned Python for data Analysis which is now my favorite tool when it comes to data analysis.
